# React, TypeScript, Webpack & Jest boilerplate

Lightweight boilerplate to kickstart your next [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) project.

Builds [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) through [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org) with [ts-loader](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-loader) & [fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/Realytics/fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin#readme) to provide sound type checking for your React components.

[Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) is also setup for TypeScript.
